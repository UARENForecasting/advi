# ADVI

ADVI (Arizona gridded Data VIsualization) is a tool to visualize weather forecasts interactively 
in the web browser using Bokeh. It is currently tailored to display forecasts from the WRF model
run by the UA Hydrology & Atmospheric Sciences Department. 

The code is MIT licensed and we welcome others to use it to visualize their forecasts. 
Please let us know (in an issue or email) if you're interested in using ADVI so we can work on abstracting the code.
